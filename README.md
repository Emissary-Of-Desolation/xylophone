# Xylophone
Xylophone is a Flutter app that allows you to play the xylophone on your mobile device, just like a real xylophone! It provides a virtual xylophone with different colorful bars representing different musical notes. When you tap on these bars, they produce the corresponding sound, allowing you to create beautiful melodies with ease.
